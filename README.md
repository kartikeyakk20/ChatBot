# ChatBot

This GitHub project showcases the development of a chatbot that accurately predicts user query responses. Leveraging an intent-based approach powered by neural networks using tflearn, the chatbot provides contextually relevant answers. The user interface is built using Streamlit, ensuring an interactive and seamless experience. The integration of Streamlit's session state feature further enhances user interactions by maintaining the application's state. Explore this project to witness the fusion of natural language processing and a user-friendly interface in action.
